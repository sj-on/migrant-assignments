         <p>In the initial days of my schooling, I was what people call an “average” kid. Then the competition grew in my class, I too was forced to cram things, the way other people do. When I viewed Chemfinity, I found the meaning to learn: WHy learning is awesome? That day I determined to become one of the “chemfinitist”: a person who is made of absolute knowledge.</p>
