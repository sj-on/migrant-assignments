# migrant-assignments
Source code for the websites/webpages I developed during my internship as a front-end developer at Migrant Solutions. 
<br>
Slack: <a href="http://migrant-group.slack.com">Slack Group</a>
<br>
Website(Migrant Solutions): https://migrant-solutions.com/
<br>
So we were supposed to submit our assignments in the form of screenshots and that's what I have shared in the repository. I edited the same index.html and style.css again and again, therefore those files are not available for upload.
<br>
We discussed:
<ul>
  <li> Websites 101</li>
  <li> Basic HTML</li>
  <li> Basic CSS</li>
  <li> Bootstrap (main focus)</li>
  <li> Basics of website design using Figma</li>
 </ul>
 I had already done some work in HTML development, so it turned out to be easy.

Hope this helps!
